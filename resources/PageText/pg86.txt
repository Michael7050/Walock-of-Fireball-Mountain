A huge jaw yawns open in front of you. By the size
of it, the CROCODILE you are swimming
towards must be at least three metres long. The
beast slaps its tail in the water and glides towards
you. You must fight two Attack Rounds.

Your combined thrashings attract a ‘turbulence’ in
the water that you had noticed before and this now
makes its way towards your part of the river. Out of
the corner of your eye you notice this and must
decide what to do. If you believe that the Crocodile
is on its last legs and you wish to continue the battle,
then do so. Otherwise you can keep the beast occupied
in the faint hope that this mysterious visitor will help
you in some way. Have one more Attack Round.
