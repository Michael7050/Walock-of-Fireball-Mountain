As you search the body, you try to avoid looking at
the terrible face, grey and decomposing. Maggots
crawl from its nose and mouth. You jump back
startled when its eyes suddenly flick open! Just in
time you avoid a vicious slash from its long sharp
fingernails. It quickly springs to its feet and eyes you
with a sadistic leer spreading across its mouth.
