The liquid is smooth and watery and, as you drink
it, you begin to glow. You feel euphoric and a little
drunk at the same time. Your confidence grows and
your weariness disappears.
The bottle contains HOLY WATER, blessed by
the Overpriest of Kaynlesh-Ma. It has restored your
STAMINA almost to full strength. Increase your
STAMINA to 2 points below your Initial STAMINA
(if your STAMINA was already higher than this,
leave it as it isâ€” you are strong enough!). Add points
to your current SKILL to take the total to 1 point
under your Initial SKILL. You add 4 LUCK
points for making such a lucky find.
If you have already looked at the parchment, you
may leave the room northwards (1). If you
have not, you may look at it (2) or you may
forget about it and go northwards anyway.
