With the Warlock now defeated, you know your
quest is almost over. You approach the door with
two locks. There are no keys around. You retrieve
two keys from your pack and try them in the locks.
They turn! You open the door and peer round (1).
If you have no keys, you may try to break
down the door, and this you will do at the cost of
almost all your STAMINA. Reduce your STAMINA
by 5 and enter the room. (2).
