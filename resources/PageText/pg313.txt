You check over the body. The poor wretch was
obviously caught in the same way that you were,
but his weaker skull shattered under the clubâ€™s
blow. He wears a suit of leather armour no better
than your own, holds a wooden shield on one wrist
and clutches a steel-bladed sword in his other hand.
In his pockets are 8 Gold Pieces and around his neck
is a silver crucifix.
You take the crucifix and the Gold.
