This is a rather unlikely story, considering that they
see very few humans around. Nevertheless, Skele-
tons are pretty dim — you knew this and that’s why
you tried the story. Roll one die. If you roll a 1 or 2,
they don’t believe you and keep on advancing.
A 3 or 4 means that they aren’t sure, and send two of
their number off through the north door whilst the
rest hold you at bay with their weapons.
A roll of 5 or 6 means they’ve believed you and they
all get back to work! Add 2 Luck points.
