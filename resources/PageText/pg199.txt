The passageway ahead widens and you can see
ahead a large cavern. As you shine your lantern
around it you can see crude stone weapons on the
floor and a smouldering fire in the centre of the
cave, But you see no way through. As you turn to
make your way back you stop in your tracks to see
two Neanderthal CAVEMEN barring your exit.
They grunt aggressively at you. You draw your
sword and must prepare to fight.
Fight them one at a time. If you win, leave the
cavern and return to the junction.
