The door opens and you find yourself in a small,
smoke-filled room. Sitting in the room around a
wooden table are four tiny men, each about one
metre tall, but all are apparently fully mature, with
weathered skin and long, bushy beards. They are
cursing, laughing and joking as they play a card
game. Each one is leaning back on his tiny chair,
puffing a long clay pipe. On the table are a number
of copper coins and four mugs of ale.
As you walk in, their merriment stops. They are on
their guard but donâ€™t appear to be too dangerous.
One stands up and makes some comment about
your lack of manners, not knocking before you came
in, The others nod their agreement. Do you:
Chat to them and try to befriend
them? (1)
Apologize, bow and leave the
room? (2)
Offer to join in their card game? (3)
Draw your sword and go for the
leader? (4)
If you have already been in this room, you find it
empty. (5)
