The old man is furious at your killing his dog! His
eyes turn white with anger. He slowly rises from his
seat and as he stands he appears to gain in size and
stature. He is changing in front of your eves. He
sprouts hair on his face and forearms. His nose
lengthens and becomes dog-like. His teeth are
pointed. He is a WEREWOLF and he advances
towards you.
You can Escape only through the door behind you to
the south. Otherwise you must fight
him.
