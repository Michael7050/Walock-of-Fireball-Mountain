During your adventure, you will have come across
various keys and should have collected some of
these. You may now use three of these keys to try to
open the locks on the chest.
Each key is identified with a number. To determine
whether you have the right keys, add their three
numbers together. Now turn to the section which
has the same number as this total, where you will
discover whether you have used the correct keys.
If you do not have three numbered keys, this is the
end of your journey. You sit on the chest and weep
as you realize that you will have to explore the
mountain once more in order to find the keys.
