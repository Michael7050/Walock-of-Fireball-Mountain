The old man thanks you and rather sheepishly ties
up his boots. You explain that you mean no harm
and he calms down, calling off his dog. He tells you
that this area is the only passageway through to the
inner chambers. Some years ago the river swelled
after a particularly severe spring thaw and cut off
supplies from the outside world. All the areaâ€™s
inhabitants starved to death but the Master, realiz-
ing he needed defences against the outside world,
put a curse on the area. The last remaining creatures
became the Undead and now guard the pass-
ageways through.
He starts to inquire about you. Will you:
Be straight with him and tell him of
your quest? (1)
Thank him for the chat and leave -
through the south door? (2)
Try to grab the keys and go for the -
nearest door? (3)
