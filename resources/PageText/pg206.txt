You enter a large square room. In the centre of the
room is a grey-haired old man sitting at a desk. His
desk is covered in papers and parchments of various
sorts and he holds a long quill pen. He is sur-
rounded by books. Thousands of them line the
shelves around the walls, from floor to ceiling. As
you enter he looks up at you. Will he recognize you?
If you have been in this room before, (1); if
not, (2).
