The old man does not look up from the table, but his
devilish little pet eyes you suspiciously and starts
chattering in a small squeaky voice. The old man
grunts and asks you whether you are game for a
wager. Will you accept (you may only do so if you
have at least one Gold Piece with you)? (1)
If not, you may either leave the room (2) or
attack the man (3).
