As you burst through the door, the old man turns to
look at you, not in the least perturbed by your intru-
sion. Suddenly he vanishes! He reappears against
the wall and, as you spin round to see him, he
laughs. Not the feeble cackle of an old man, but the
booming laugh of a much younger man. Again he
disappears, and reappears in another corner of the
room, glaring at you and taunting you with his
evil laugh. You swirl round just in time to see him
disappear again. This time he reappears in the
air above you and slowly floats down to you. His
glaring eyes make you shiver as they approach.
