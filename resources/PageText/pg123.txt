Will they believe your story about buying a boat?
Skeletons are pretty simple-minded, so roll one die.
A 1, 2 or 3 means they believe you, and they all go
running through the door in the north wall, leaving
you alone in the Boat House. Add 2 Luck points.
A 4 or 5 means they’re not sure. They send two of
their members through the north door whilst the
other three watch you with their makeshift
weapons.
A roll of 6 means they definitely don’t believe you
and keep on advancing.
