There is a right-hand turn to the north in the pass-
age. Cautiously you approach a sentry post on the
corner and, as you look in, you can see a strange
Goblin-like creature in leather armour asleep at his
post. You try to tiptoe past him. Test your Luck. If
you are Lucky, he does not wake up and remains
snoring loudly. If you are Unlucky, you
step with a crunch on some loose ground and his
eyes flick open.
