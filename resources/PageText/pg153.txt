As you put the two swords into your belt, your new
one seems to take on a mind of its own. It cuts your
leg (lose 1 STAMINA point) and, as you draw it out,
it turns rubbery in your hand. Itâ€™s useless now so
you fling it into the river. It seems that the only way
forward is for you to swim eastwards down the
river. You plunge in and start swimming.
