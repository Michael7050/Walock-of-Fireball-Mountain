You have entered a large square room. Broken pot-
tery lies scattered all about. One large clay vase is
untouched and is full of clear liquid. A large bowl is
full of gold coins. As you enter the room the door
slams behind you and you swing round to face a
strange-looking creature, half man, half bull - who
is glaring at you. He is a MINOTAUR, and he
stalks towards you!
He lowers his head, horns pointing at your chest,
and charges. You must fight him (1).
After three Attack Rounds, you manoeuvre yourself
round to be able to run through the door. If you
wish to Escape at this time, pay the
penalty.
If you have already been in this room on this
adventure and killed the Minotaur, you find it
empty. Type (2).
