You load the bow and fire, but despair as the arrow
flies through the air directly at him, stops centi-
metres from his chest and falls to the floor. He looks:
up and smiles at you with an evil, gloating smile.
What can you do:
Draw your sword and advance? (1)
Try something else from your
backpack? (2)
