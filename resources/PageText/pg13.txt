Your head hurts and you feel dizzy as you rise to
your feet. The four men stir into action and move
towards you in single file with their weapons ready.
You grope your way down the wall for the south
door but it will be touch and go whether you make
it. Your foot slips on a loose pebble and you fall to
the ground. Before you can regain your footing, the
creatures are upon you.
