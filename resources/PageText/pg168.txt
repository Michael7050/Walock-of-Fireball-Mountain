You open the door to a large room. A large chair
behind a solid-looking table suggests to you that
someone, or something, of rank uses this room. A
chest in the centre catches your eye. In a corner of
the room stands a man-sized creature with a warty
face, standing over a smaller creature of similar race.
With the whip in his hand, the ORC CHIEFTAIN
has been beating his servant, who is whimpering
beneath him, Will you:
Attack them both? (1)
Spring at the Chieftain in the hope
that his servant will aid you? (2)
Leave the room and head back for
the junction? (3)
