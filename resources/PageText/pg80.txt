The key fits the lock and opens the door. You find
yourself in a large boathouse. Various boats, in
different stages of construction, are lying around.
Apart from the door behind you, there is another in
the north wall. As you enter, the Skeletons stop
their work and crane their bony necks around to:
look at you. They pick up planks of wood and ham-
mers and advance towards you. There are five ot
them. Do you:
Smile nervously and back out of
the door into the passage? (1).
Tell them youâ€™ve come about
buying a boat? (2).
Tell them you're their new boss
and order them back to work? (3).
Draw your sword and prepare for
battle? (4).
