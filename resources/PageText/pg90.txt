You open the door into a narrow passage and follow
it northwards. Some metres up the passageway, it
turns to the east, then turns to the north. However,
at this second bend, there is a small alcove in the
rock, It seems a convenient hiding place and a large
rock forms a comfortable seat. You may stop here
and eat Provisions if you wish. When you have
rested, continue northwards.
