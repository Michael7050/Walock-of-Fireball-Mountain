A voice bids you ‘Come in!’ and you walk into a
small room furnished with a table and chair,
shelves, cupboards and the like, all of which have
seen better days. Plates, bowls, cups and hundreds
of old books line the shelves. In the midst of all this
clutter, you see a little old man in a grubby white
gown swaying to and fro in a rocking chair, still
humming happily to himself, his eyes fixed on you,
but seeming at peace with the world. He bids you
‘Good day.’ Do you:
Start to make conversation with
him? (1)
Draw your sword and charge at
him? (2)
Decide not to waste time with him
and leave, going northwards? (3)
