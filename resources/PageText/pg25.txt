The paintings are portraits of men. Your spine shiv-
ers as you read the nameplate under the one on the
west wall — it is that of Zagor, the Warlock whose
treasure you are seeking. You look at his portrait
and realize you are pitting yourself against an awe-
some adversary. You have the feeling that you are
being watched and notice the piercing eyes follow-
ing you as you move. You find yourself drawn
towards his portrait and your fear rises. Lose 1
SKILL point. Do you have the courage to try to
combat the Warlock? You may either leave through
the north door straightaway — but treat
this as an Escape. Or you may look through your
pack for a weapon to use against the Warlock’s
power.
