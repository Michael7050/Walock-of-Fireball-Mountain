You open your pack and reach inside for something
suitable to throw across the cavern. Check your
Equipment List, choose one item to throw and cross
it off your List. If you have no Equipment you will
have to throw a Gold Piece. You throw the object
across the cavern, where it lands with a clatter. The
Ogre looks towards the noise, and goes over to
investigate. Meanwhile you creep out, down the
passage and back to the junction.
