You pick up the rope. It looks normal. In fact it looks
as if it might be quite useful. You open your pack to
put it in. Suddenly, it comes alive in your fingers,
snakes quickly up your arm and attempts to wrap
itself around your neck. You struggle to cut the rope
with your sword before its grip tightens. Test your
Luck. If you are Lucky, you cut the rope and it drops
to the ground. If you are not, the rope tightensâ€”lose
1 STAMINA point. You must Test your Luck again to
try to cut the rope, and keep trying until you do.
Each time you fail, you lose another STAMINA
point (and reduce your LUCK score). If you finally
defeat the rope, you may leave through the north
door.
