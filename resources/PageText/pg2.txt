Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, you escape without
attracting the Ogreâ€™s attention. If you are Unlucky,
you curse as you kick a small stone which goes
skidding across the cavern floor. You draw your
sword in case the Ogre has heard it. If
vou were Lucky, you creep down the corridor back
to the crossroads.
