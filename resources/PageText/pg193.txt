The door opens and you enter a small room. Your
eyes widen as you look around to see that the
walls of the room are covered in ornate stonework.
Mosaics and marble inlays give this room a kind of
beauty you have never seen before. In a corner of
the room is a large metal statue of a one-eyed crea-
ture. In its single eye is a sparkling jewel. As there
appear to be no other ways through the room, you
will have to go back to the junction â€” but that large
jewel is very tempting. Will you leave it alone and
go back to the junction (1) or try to take the
jewel with you (2)?
