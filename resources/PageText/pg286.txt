The narrow staircase is cut into the rock and there
are about twenty steps leading down. At the bottom
of the steps a passageway leads you into a large
open chamber. This chamber stinks of putrefying
flesh. The smell is so bad that you are tempted to
turn back. Three bodies lie in the chamber. You may
either search the bodies, or tiptoe quietly through
the room. What will you do:
Search the first body? (1)
Search the second body? (2)
Search the third body? (3)
Tiptoe through the room? (4)
