You are in a north-south corridor which ends in a
dead end. You look around the rock face for signs of
anything interesting, when suddenly a rock breaks
loose above you and lands on your head. Although
the blow was not particularly hard, you find you are
feeling dizzy. You fight to remain conscious, but are
unable to do so. You slump to the ground. When
you open your eyes, you are at a junction.
