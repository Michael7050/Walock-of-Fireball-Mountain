You sheathe your sword and walk up to the water.
Is it safe to swim? Although you cannot see any
immediate signs of danger either in the water or
around its banks, there is no way through on the
north side of the river. You suddenly notice a gleam-
ing sword lying on the river bed several steps in.
You wade in to retrieve it. It is light in your hand, far
less cumbersome than your own weapon, and it has
a keen edge. This marvellous weapon will add 1
point to your SKILL whilst you use it. Note this on
your Equipment List. A mysterious voice speaking
directly to your mind seems to be telling you to
throw your own sword into the river. Will you? If
so, (1). If you want to keep both swords, (2).
