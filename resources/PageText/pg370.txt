The door opens to reveal a small room. The room is
dirty and unkempt. A straw mattress lies in one
corner. In the centre of the room is a wooden table
upon which a candle burns, lighting the room withâ€™
its flickering flame. A small box rests under the
table. Seated around the table are two small
creatures with warty skin, dressed in leather
armour. They are drinking some sort of grog and, by
the way they stagger to their feet on your arrival,
you assume they are very drunk. You may either
draw your sword and leap forward at them (1)
or slam the door quickly and run on up the
passage (2).
