As you step into the room, the door swings shut
behind you. As it closes, there is a click and a hiss.
From the centre of the ceiling, a jet of gas is filling
the room with an acrid vapour. You breathe and
cough deeply. You look at the door and then the
key. Will you return to the door and escape quickly
(1) or hold your breath and dash for the
key first (2)?
