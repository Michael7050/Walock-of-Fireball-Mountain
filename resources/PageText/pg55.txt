Roll two dice. If the total rolled is less than or equal
to your LUCK score and is also less than or equal to
your STAMINA Score, then you manage to hold on
and manoeuvre the raft across to the north bank (do
not deduct a LUCK point). You arrive safely but as
you step on to the bank, the raft drifts away and
makes its own way across the river to the south
bank.
If you exceed your LUCK and/or STAMINA totals,
the raft throws you into the water and you start to
swim back to the south bank.
