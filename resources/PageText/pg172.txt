The old man’s eyes flutter open. He sees you and
grabs for a half oar lying by his bench. You tell him
you mean him no harm but he remains on guard
and eyes you cautiously. Although he looks harm-
less enough, his dog could be dangerous. The man’s
boots are undone. Will you:
Rush the dog with your weapon
drawn? (1)
Ask the man questions regarding
your quest? (2)
Tell him his boots are undone? (3)
