As you swing your sword at the creature, it reaches
out and catches the blade in its hand! Your weapon
is almost ineffective against the considerable
strength of the creature. You realize this and panic,
but you must fight on. If you wish to
try to Escape, which you may only do after 6 full
Attack Rounds, you will have to be lucky. Test your
Luck. If you are Lucky, you may Escape through the
west door. If you are Unlucky, you
must continue this fight for a further 6 Attack
Rounds before trying to Escape again. If you roll an
11 or 12 and you are Unlucky (i.e. your current
LUCK score is below 11), then you end up on page 224.
