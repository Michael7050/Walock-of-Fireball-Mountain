You awake with a throbbing head and look around.
The room is about eight metres square, with doors
to the north and south. You have been dumped in
the south-west corner. Standing motionless in the
centre of the room are four men. At least, they appear
to be men. Their skin is a greeny-grey colour. Their
_ clothes are tattered and torn - and they are all
staring vacantly at the ceiling. One carries a club,
one a scythe, one an axe and one a pick. They are
ignoring you completely.
Around the room are various peasant-style
weapons (pitchforks, axe-handles, pointed sticks,
etc.), one or two shields, and several barrels. In the
north-east corner is a human corpse with a sword in
one hand and a shield in the other. You move your
hand up to your head to feel for signs of blood and
you are relieved to find you are not bleeding. But as
your hand moves, the strange creatures in the
centre of the room turn their eyes down towards
you. Do you:
Try to talk to them? (1)
Jump to your feet and charge them
with your sword? (2)
Scramble for an exit through the
south door? (3)
