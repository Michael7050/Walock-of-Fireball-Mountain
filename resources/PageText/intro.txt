Before embarking on your adventure, you must first
determine your own strengths and weaknesses.
You have in your possession a sword and a shield
together with a rucksack containing provisions
(food and drink) for the trip. You have been prepar-
ing for your quest by training yourself in swordplay
and exercising vigorously to build up your stamina.
To see how effective your preparations have been,
you must use the dice to determine your initial
SKILL and STAMINA Scores.
