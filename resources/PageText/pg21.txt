The green blood of the dead Orcs smells foul as it
seeps from their bodies. You step around the
corpses and investigate the chest. It is a sturdy
affair, made of strong oak and iron, and it is firmly
locked. You may try to smash the lock with your
sword (1) or leave it alone and go through
the open door (2).
