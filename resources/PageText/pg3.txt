The bell gives a dull clang and after a few moments
you see a withered old man climb into a small row-
ing boat moored on the north bank. He rows slowly
across to you, moors the boat and limps towards
you. He asks you for 3 Gold Pieces. When you
protest at the price he mumbles some flimsy excuse
about ‘inflation’. He begins to get angry at your
protestations. Do you pay him the 3 Gold Pieces
(1) or threaten him (2)?
