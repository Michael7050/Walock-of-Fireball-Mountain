As you enter the cavern you hear loud footsteps
behind you, crunching heavily on the rocky floor.
You crouch down beside the entrance in a small
alcove in the rock. The steps get louder and you see
a great OGRE enter the cavern! He stands over two
metres tall and is dressed in ill-fitting garments
made from some sort of hide. He carries a large
wooden club. You may:
Attack him as he enters (1).
Try to creep out without him
noticing you (2).
Try to distract him by throwing
something into a far corner
of the cavern (3).
