Going through the door you enter a large room.
Various bits of wooden debris are strewn untidily
across the floor. Apart from your entrance door,
there is also a door in the north wall. In one corner is
a crude wooden desk with a box on it. In another
corner, apparently asleep (or dead), is a hideous
looking man-sized creature with warty skin, wild
hair and long claws for fingernails. Will you tiptoe
out through the north door (1) or tiptoe
across to the desk to look at the box (2)?
