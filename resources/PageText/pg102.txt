The door is not locked and opens. The room in front
of you seems to be a small torture chamber, with
various torture devices around the walls. In the
centre of the room, two small, hunchbacked
creatures are having their fiendish way with a
Dwarf, who is tied to a hook in the ceiling by his
wrists. The two hunchbacks are poking and cutting
him viciously with their swords. The Dwarf lets out
a final scream and falls silent, eyes closed. His cap-
tors make disappointed noises and look round
angrily at you as if it were your fault that the Dwarf
has collapsed. You must act quickly. Will you:
Close the door quickly and
continue up the corridor? (1)
Draw your sword and try to fight
the creatures? (2)
Stride over to the Dwarf, give him a
jab with your sword and put on
an evil laugh for the torturers? (3)
