Your opponent is surprised as you disappear in
front of him, but he raises his hands as if to cover his
eyes and he scans the room with an intense glare.
He can sense your presence but cannot make out
exactly where you are. You draw your sword and
advance. He tilts his head and sniffs the air. You will
have to fight him from a distance as, if he gets his
hands on you, your invisibility will be no advan-
tage. But whilst you remain invisible, you have the
following advantages:
            You may add 2 to your dice roll when determining
                        your Attack Strength.
            Each successful attack will cause him 3 points of
             damage as, since he cannot see you, he cannot
                      defend himself properly.
               Each time he inflicts a wound on you, throw one
                 die. If the number is odd, he wounds you as
               normal. If the number is 2 or 4, he only inflicts a
               1-point wound. If you roll a 6, you can parry the
                        blow and he does no damage.
