The passage runs northwards, and ahead you can
hear the splashings of an underground river. The air
becomes cool and fresh. You soon reach a wide
opening of a river bank but despair as you look
across to see no way through on the other side. To
the east the river flows through a cave in the rock.
You may either sit, rest and eat Provisions (1) or
continue by what seems to be the only way
forward, jumping into the river and swimming
downstream (2).
