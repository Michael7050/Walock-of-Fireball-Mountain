You search the bodies of the dead Orcs but find only
a few teeth, nails, bones and knives in their pockets.
You search the cupboards around the room but find
only crude bowls, plates and spoons. But under the
serving hatch you find a thin leather case half a
metre long. You may open the case (1) or
you may leave it behind and walk out of the door
(2). You are proud of your victory and
add 1 SKILL and 5 STAMINA points.
