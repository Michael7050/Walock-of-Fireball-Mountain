The slain creature crashes to the ground. You go
through his garments and find nothing, but a small
pouch hangs around his neck. Inside this pouch is a
small bronze key, with the number 9 cast into it. You
take this. Nothing else is of value in
the cavern so you leave and head back to the junc-
tion.
