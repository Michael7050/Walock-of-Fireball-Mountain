You place the helmet on your head. It fits well. A
glow begins to fill your body and you seem to pos-
sess a power and confidence beyond anything you
have felt before. The helmet is blessed with magic
and will allow you to add 1 point to all future dice
rolls when computing your own Attack Strength
during combat so long as you wear it. Note this on
your Equipment List and return to the junction.
