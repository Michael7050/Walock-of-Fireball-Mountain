As you walk up the passage, it visibly widens and
eventually you find yourself standing at the mouth
of a rough cavern, a natural cave in the rock. As you
look into the darkness, the cavern appears to be
about 30 metres deep, with no visible exit. Do you
want to go into the cavern (1) or go back to
the junction (2)?
