The dog springs as you move. Its hideous black
teeth are coming straight for your throat! Two
metres from you, a blast of fire shoots from its
mouth right at your face! You duck just in time but
must now fight the beast.
In addition to its normal attack, throw one die every
Attack Round for its fiery breath. On a roll of 1 or 2,
it scorches you for 1 point of damage — subtract from
your STAMINA-— but on a roll of 3-6, you avoid the
blast. You may use your LUCK against the fire. The
only Escape open is through the south door.
The old man watches the fight but does not move
unless you kill his dog. If you kill the dog, you may
Escape through the south door (turn to 66), but you
will not have time to take anything with you. Or you can
choose to stay. Add 1 LUCK point anyway.
