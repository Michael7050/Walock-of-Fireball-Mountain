As you swim to the bank away from the Crocodile
you look back to see the mysterious ‘turbulence’
approach the reptile’s body, break into a frenzy and
then move off, leaving not a trace of the animal.
Thankful that you were not there to find out what it
was, you lift yourself out of the water on to the north
bank. Add 1 SKILL and 2 LUCK points.
