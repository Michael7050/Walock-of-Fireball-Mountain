The door is locked. You may try to charge it down by
rolling two dice. If the number rolled is equal to or
less than your SKILL score, the door bursts open.
If the number is greater than your SKILL
score, the door remains locked, you lose 1
STAMINA point for your bruised shoulder and you
must progress up the passage.
