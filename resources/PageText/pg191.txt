He shrieks and hides behind his desk. He is terrified
of your aggressive manner. His squeaky little voice .
explains that he is the Mazemaster in charge of The
Maze of Zagor. You talk to him and reassure him
that you mean no harm and he eventually comes out
from behind the desk. He sits down and as his
confidence returns, a strange thing happens. His
manner becomes firm and self-assured. He refers to
a book, points his finger and the book slips from
the shelf and floats on to the desk in front of him.
You deduce that he is a Wizard of some power; per-
haps even the dungeon Master himself, come to
investigate you. You ask him the way out of the
maze. He tells you to leave by the south door, walk
past a door on your right until you can go no further
and turn left. Go over a crossroads and turn left at
the next one.
If you take his advice, leave
through the south door and keep
going until you reach the second
crossroads (1).
If you leave through the south door
but intend to make your own
way round (2).
If you leave via the west door (3).
