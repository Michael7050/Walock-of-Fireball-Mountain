You squat on the sandy bank. As you prepare your
meal you notice a movement in the sand a couple of
metres to your left. The movement becomes quite
turbulent and you spring to your feet, sword at the
ready. Suddenly a large tubular head breaks
through the surface, twists around in the air and
picks up your scent. The smooth, segmented body
of a GIANT SANDWORM rears up and sways
over in your direction. As it does so, a large orifice,
with short, spiky teeth, opens in what must be its
head. You must do battle with this creature.
If you want to Escape, after three Attack Rounds,
you may dive into the river and swim downstream,
but you have lost the Provisions you started to eat.
