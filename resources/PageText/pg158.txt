The water around you bristles with activity, as if an
invisible hand is dropping unseen pebbles into the
river. You gulp- PIRANHAS !â€”and you begin to
feel their sharp teeth biting into your flesh. You kick
with your limbs and slash with your weapons to
keep them off until you reach the south bank. Treat
the Piranhas as a single creature.
Resolve this battle.
If you win, you manage to scramble out of the water
and lie panting on the south bank. You may eat
Provisions here.
