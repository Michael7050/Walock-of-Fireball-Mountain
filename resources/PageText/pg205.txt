he door opens and you find yourself ina dark crypt
of some kind. The room is very large. At one end is
an altar, and various coffins are strewn about the
room. There is a door behind you in the south wall,
and also one in the west wall. If you want to investi-
gate the room further,(1). If the place gives
you the creeps, you can leave via the west door (2).
