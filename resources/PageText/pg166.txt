You land in the icy water and frantically swim for
the south bank. To your amazement the raft turns
round in mid-stream and makes its own way back to
the south bank. You quicken your pace, aware that
your splashings may at any time attract the atten-
tions of any underwater creatures living in the river.
Roll one die. If you roll a 1, 2, 3 or 4 you make it safely
back to the south bank.
