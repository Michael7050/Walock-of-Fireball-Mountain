To your horror, you realize that this dummy lever
was a trap! Although it looked like a handle, it was
in fact a wax-coated sword blade and it has now cut
your hand badly. Did you use your right or your left
hand?
Roll one die. If the number you roll is odd, this was
your sword hand and your fighting prowess has
been severely hampered. Lose 3 sK1L1 points and 1
STAMINA. If you rolled an even number, you used
your other hand, and so the injury is not quite so
important. Lose 1 SKILL point and 2 STAMINA.
Now pull the right lever.
