The passage continues for quite some time, then
you reach the foot of a staircase cut into the rock.
You ascend the stairs and they end at a wooden
door with rusty hinges. Listening at the door, you
can hear some scratching sounds. You try the
handle and the door creaks open. You step into a
bare room scattered with bones. There is a door on
the wall opposite. Gnawing at the bones are three
GIANT RATS which stop to look at you as you
enter. Each is at least one metre long and their tatty
coats indicate that they are fighters. You will have to
take them on if you are going to get through the
room, as they no doubt see you as a tasty meal. If
you have collected any Cheese during your adven-
ture, (1). Otherwise, (2).
