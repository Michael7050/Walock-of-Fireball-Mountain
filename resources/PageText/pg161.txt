Your tappings and scrapings at the rock face as you
search for secret doors and passageways resound
through the dungeon corridors. Various creatures
roam freely through the underworld and your
noises have just attracted the attentions of one of the
following monsters.
Roil one die, and see what has come to
investigate. Fight the creature as normal.
Wandering monsters never carry any treasure.
If you defeat this monster,
return to your previous page.
