As the ‘turbulence’ surrounds you, you can feel the
jostlings of many small fish. They start ripping your
flesh with vicious bites and you realize that you are
surrounded by deadly PIRANHAS!
If, during your struggle with the Crocodile, you
have wounded it, you are lucky and most of the fish
attack the bleeding reptile. If you have not wounded
the Crocodile, then the fish may go for either you or
it. Throw one die. If you throw a 1 or 2, the majority
of the Piranhas go for you. If you throw a 3-6, the
majority attack the Crocodile.
Treat the Piranhas as a single creature.
It you win you can swim to shore. Turn to 7. You
may eat Provisions here — and restore 1 LUCK point.
