The old man asks you your stake. You may bet
between 1 and 20 Gold Pieces (but not more than
you possess!). He tosses the white dice he has been
playing with to you and asks you to roll. Roll two
dice once for yourself and once for the old man. If
your total is higher, you win the amount of your
stake from the old man. If his total is higher, you
lose your stake. You may continue for as long as you
have Gold Pieces, and then leave through the door
and return to the junction. Add 2 points to your
SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK scores if you have won.
