A sign above the door reads “Boat House’. The door
is firmly locked but a small barred window allows
you to look inside. You can see a number of
Skeleton-men working on building a boat of some
sort. They move in a series of quick, jerky actions,
rather insect-like.
If you have a key clearly labelled
‘Boat House’ (1).
If you want to try to break the door
down, (2).
If you want to return to the
riverbank and try another route (3).
