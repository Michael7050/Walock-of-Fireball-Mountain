You charge the door, hitting it squarely with your
shoulder. Roll 2 dice. If the number rolled is equal to
or less than your SKILL score, the door opens.
If the number exceeds your SKILL Score, the
door shudders but does not budge, and you wince
in pain as you hit the door â€” lose 1 STAMINA point
and continue up the corridor.
