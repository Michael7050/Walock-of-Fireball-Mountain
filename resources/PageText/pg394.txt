The boots are well-fashioned in a deep red leather.
They are much sturdier than your own and fit you
well. You try a few steps but are horrified to find
that you cannot move, and the boots seem to be
gripping your feet with considerable force. As you
struggle to free yourself, you hear a crack and a
smash as a Stalactite falls from the roof; you crane
round to see a large black shape shifting towards
you. As it approaches, you turn cold. Several
metres away is a GIANT SPIDER, at least a metre
across, advancing towards you on spiny legs,
mandibles clicking nervously in anticipation of its
next meal, You draw your sword to defend yourself
as it stalks you. You cannot move and thus must
subtract 2 from each dice roll you make to calculate
your Attack Strength.
