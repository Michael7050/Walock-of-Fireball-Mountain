You open the door into a large room which can only
be the dining room of the same warty-faced
creatures you now recognize. Sitting round a large
table are five ORCS busily drinking and dribbling
their bowls of rat-gizzard soup. All are involved in a
rowdy argument as to who will get to chew the rat
bones left in the large soup cauldron, so they do not
see you enter. You may be bold and prepare to
attack them (1) or you may not relish the
prospect of taking on five of these creatures and try
to escape. If you wish to leave the room, Test your
Luck. If you are Lucky, you get out without them
noticing - there is no penalty for escap-
ing. If you are Unlucky, they notice you,
Prepare for battle.
