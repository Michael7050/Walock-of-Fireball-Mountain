The four creatures shuffling towards you are mind-
less ZOMBIES. Their vacant eyes suggest that
their actions are controlled by a will which is not
their own. You are still too dizzy to think properly,
but you must act quickly. The first Zombie reaches
you and prepares to swing his club. You must fight
him.
If you defeat the first Zombie, add 2 Luck points
and turn to face the other three.
