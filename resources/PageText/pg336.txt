You are in a small, foul-smelling room. You notice
two doors: one to the west and one behind you to
the south. The furniture in the room is sparse and
has been made mostly from bits of old boats. There
appears to be nothing of value in the room, but a
bunch of keys hangs on the wall. An old man in
ragged clothes is slumped asleep on a ‘bench’ made
from half a rowing boat, snoring loudly. Next to him
is a vicious-looking brown dog with red eyes and
black teeth, whom you have awakened and who
now is eyeing you suspiciously. A deep growl is
coming from its throat. You may:
Tiptoe an exit through the south
door (1)
Bang on the door behind you and
cough a few ‘Ahem’s’ to wake up
the old man (2).
Leap across the room with sword
drawn to cut down the dog (3).
