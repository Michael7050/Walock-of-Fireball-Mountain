You are on the south bank of an underground river
facing across its black depths. There appear to be
four ways of crossing. To your left, a rusted bell
bears the sign: ‘Ferry Service 2 Gold Pieces — Please
ring.’ There is a small raft in front of you on the
bank with a long stick resting beside it: you could
punt across the river. A rickety old bridge crosses on
the right. If you don’t trust any of these, you may
swim. Which will you choose?
