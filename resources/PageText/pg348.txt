You are in a pit, a little bruised but not too seriously
hurt. You look around as you get back on your feet
and can see two passageways: a short one to the
south which opens into a small chamber, and
another heading northwards. You are a little
worried about the crash your fall has made, and
even more by the gruntings you can hear coming
from the chamber to the south. Before you can col-
lect your thoughts, a large, ugly head pokes around
the corner and a TROLL emerges from its
chamber. Your ankle is twisted and you cannot
move quickly, but the Troll is ready for a fight. You
will have to face the brute. (1) - but if you
have a Potion of Invisibility, (2).
