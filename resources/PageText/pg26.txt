You remember Di Maggio’s small, leather-bound
book, and silently mouth the spell contained within
its pages.
You shout loudly at the Dragon and it stops in its
tracks. It cocks its head to one side and eyes vou
suspiciously. You fling a stone at its head, and the
rock bounces off its nose. The beast lets out an angry
cry and breathes deeply, a roaring sound being
created from within its throat. The Dragon exhales,
and from between its teeth you can see another
fireball building up. You prepare yourself, and as
the ball of flame comes from its mouth, you cry:
                 ‘Ekil Erif
                  Ekam Erif
                  Erif Erif
                  Di Maggio’
The fireball continues no further. With an agonized
scream, the Dragon tries to shake the flames from its
snout, But there the burning continues.
Squealing in agony, the Dragon turns its back and
leaps into the blackness, flailing its head from side
to side.
