The door splits along its length and you can wrench
the timbers apart to let yourself in. A torch hangs
from one wall lighting up a small armoury room
stocked with swords, shields, helmets, daggers,
breastplates and the like. You examine the
weaponry and find nothing appearing superior to
your own sword. However, a circular iron shield
with a golden crescent at its centre catches your eye.
You pick it up and feel its weight on your arm. If you
wish to take this shield, it will aid you in battles by
helping to fend off wound damage inflicted by a
creature on you. If, in future during a battle in which
you are using this shield, a creature wounds you,
you may throw one die. If you throw a 6, the
creature inflicts only 1 point of damage instead of
the normal 2. If, for some reason, the creature
would normally only inflict 1 point of damage, then â€”
a successful roll of 6 would mean that no damage is
done. However, the shield is heavy and you will
have to leave behind one item of equipment (adjust
your Equipment List) to be able to carry it.
You now leave the room and continue up the
corridor.
