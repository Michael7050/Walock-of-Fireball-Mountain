The passageway twists sharply northwards and
ahead you can hear water flowing. You eventually
reach the south bank of an underground river. As
you stand on the pebbled bank you hear a fluttering
of wings and look up to see three GIANT BATS
swooping down on you to attack. Fight these three
as a single creature.
You may Escape by jumping into the river.
