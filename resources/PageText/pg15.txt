As you sit on the bench and eat your food, you begin
to feel deeply relaxed and the aches from your body
seem to be soothing themselves away. This resting
place is enchanted. You may restore 2 additional
STAMINA points as well as the normal amount (but
only if this does not exceed vour Initial STAMINA
score) and restore 1 SKILL point if any have been
lost. When you are ready to continue, move along
the passage.
