The silence is deathly. A slow drip startles you as
you creep around the coffins. The altar is ornately
carved and studded with jewels. Beautifully woven
drapes hang from the walls although they are
threadbare in places. There are three coffins in the
room. A creaking noise makes you whirl round and
the light from your lantern falls on the largest coffin.
It is opening!
As you watch, a tall man with a white face sits
upright. His eyes open and fall on you. His expres-
sion changes from one of tranquillity to one of abject
hate. His mouth opens and a terrifying hiss comes
from his throat. His teeth are wolf-like. He beckons
you to come over. Do you:
Approach him as he wishes? (1)
Draw your sword and prepare to
fight? (2)
Reach into your bag for another
means of attack? (3)
Run for the west door? (4)
