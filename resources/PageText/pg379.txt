As you prepare to strike the box, the rumbling
sound gets louder. You lift your sword high and
prepare to strike. As your blade comes down on the
box, a loud crack deafens you and, from one corner
of the room, a small bolt of lightning darts through
the air to the sword hilt, sending you reeling across
the room.
Test your luck. If you are Lucky, your sword has
shattered and lies on the floor, but you managed to
release your grip just before the lightning struck. If
you are Unlucky, your charred remains have
formed a small black outline on the floor. Next time,
do not try to strike the chest! If you were Lucky, you
may try to use keys from your rucksack.
