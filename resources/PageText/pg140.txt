The Skeletons advance and force you back to the
door. The leader approaches, with two behind, and
the final two behind them. Resolve the battle by first
fighting the leader, and then fighting the pairs.
Both members of a pair will have a separate attack on
you in each Attack Round, but you must choose which of
the two you will fight.
Attack your chosen Skeleton as a normal
battle. Against the other you will throw for your
Attack Strength in the normal way, but you will not
wound it if your Attack Strength is the greater, you
must just count this as though you have defended
against its blow. Of course if its Attack Strength is
greater, it has wounded you in the normal way.
