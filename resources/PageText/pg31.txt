If you have the jewel from the Eye of the Cyclops,
you hold it in front of the Warlock. His intimidating
stare turns to an expression of pain. He obviously
feels the jewelâ€™s power. Suddenly his eyes turn
white and his expression goes limp. Your confi-
dence gains as you realize you have won your first
real battle. Gain 2 SKILL points. Put the jewel into
your pack and leave through the north door.
