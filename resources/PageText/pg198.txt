One of the keys turns, but the other two will not fit.
As you struggle to try to make them turn, you hear
two small clicks and then ‘pings’ as two miniature
darts shoot from the chest at you. You leap back-
wards to try to avoid them, crack your head on the
wall behind you, and slump to the floor, uncon-
scious.
Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, the darts miss you,
and you awake with a sore head. Lose 2 STAMINA
points. If you are Unlucky, the darts strike and you
never recover consciousness. If you were Lucky, you
may try different keys (remember — one of the keys
you just used fits perfectly). Add the key totals and
turn to that page.
If you have tried all combinations for the keys that
you have, you bury your head in your hands and
weep after having got so far. You are so near to
achieving your objective, but you will have to try
again. Re-enter the dungeon— but remember to look
for keys as you progress!
