You arrive at the end of the passage, where it meets
another going east-west. But an iron portcullis
blocks your way and no amount of charging is going
to budge it. On the wall to your right are two levers
and it seems likely that these levers have something
to do with raising the portcullis. Do you wish to pull
the right lever or the left lever?
Right (1).
Left (2).
