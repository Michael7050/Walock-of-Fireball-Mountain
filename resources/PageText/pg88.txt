You enter another small room, bare except for a
fountain in the middle. Not a particularly grand
affair, the fountain is a small carved fish, and a short
jet of water comes from its mouth. A wooden sign
hangs from the fish and this bears a message. It is
written in Goblin tongue, at which you are not very
proficient. The first word you cannot understand,
but the others read: ‘... NOT DRINK’. But you are
extremely thirsty. Will you drink from the fountain?
If so, (1). Otherwise you can pass it by and
leave through a door in the north wall (2).
