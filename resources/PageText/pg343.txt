The door bursts open and you fall headlong into a
room. But your heart jumps as you realize you are
not landing on the floor, but plunging down a pit of
some kind! Luckily the pit is not particularly deep
and you land in a heap less than two metres down.
Lose 1 STAMINA point for your bruises, climb out
of the pit into the room and leave through the door,
heading westwards.
