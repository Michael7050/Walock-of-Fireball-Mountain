The drawers are all full of nails, tacks and miscel-
laneous bits and pieces. In one drawer is a copper-
coloured key, inscribed with the number 66 which
looks interesting. You may keep this key if vou
discard one item of equipment you are carrying.
Adjust your Equipment on your Adventure Sheet if
you want to take the key. The noise from the north
gets louder. You go to the north door to investigate.
