You chat about various things and they seem eager
to be friendly. They feel lonely in the dungeon with
so much evil about and are happy to speak to
visitors of a lawful disposition. They tell you that
you are in The Maze of Zagor. The only way out is to
go deeper into the dungeon. They tell you that the
way through the maze is to leave the room, turn
right, right, left, keep going straight ... and then
they begin to get a bit vague. Theyâ€™re not entirely
sure it is correct.
You may, if you wish, eat a meal from your Pro-
visions, but you will have to share it with them and
thus will only gain half the normal STAMINA
points. Eventually you thank them and leave the
room.
