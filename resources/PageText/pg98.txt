As you crawl into the room, a voice booms out:
‘Welcome, adventurer. I have been expecting you.’
You stop, look around and rise to your feet. The
little old man has changed. He is not so old and grey
any more, and he’s of an imposing height. His eyes
are deep and black and they are fixed on you relentlessly.
