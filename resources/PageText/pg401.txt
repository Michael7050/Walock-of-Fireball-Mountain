The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is no more and
you are now the owner of the Sorcerer’s riches. At
least a thousand Gold Pieces, jewellery, diamonds,
rubies and pearls are in the chest. Hidden under
these you find the Warlock’s spell book and as you
leaf through the pages, you realize that this tome is
probably more valuable than all the treasure.
Instructions are given for the control of all the
secrets — and the creatures — of Firetop Mountain.
With this book, unlimited power is yours and the
safety of your return to the village is ensured. Or, if
you would prefer, you could remain as master of the domain
of Firetop Mountain...


Congratulations! Game Won!
