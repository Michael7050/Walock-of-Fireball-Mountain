You poke around looking for signs of secret doors
but can find none. You pause to ponder your situa-
tion and a small jet of gas hisses from the ceiling.
You cough and choke to clear your lungs, but:
collapse to your knees. Your head spins and you
flop to the floor in an unconscious heap. When you
come to, you look around in an unfamiliar place.
