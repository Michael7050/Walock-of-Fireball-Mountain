The old man glares at you as you enter the room.
You may either apologize, explain that you lost your
way and leave through either the door in the west
(1) or south (2) walls, or alterna-
tively you may try to talk to the old man. If you want
to talk to him, you can either be pleasant (3)
or you can demand that he answers your questions (4).
