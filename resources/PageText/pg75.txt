You sit back and rest from the exhausting battle.
You may eat Provisions here. You prise the jewel
from the still statue. It is heavy in your hand and is
worth 50 Gold Pieces. You put it in your pack. As
you explore the room and the statue, you notice that
one of its breastplate sections is loose. When you
open this, a small key is inside. You examine this
and notice the number 112 on it. With a smile you
put the jewel and the key in your pack and set off
back to the junction. Add 3
