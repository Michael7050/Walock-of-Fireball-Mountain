The Wererat slumps to the ground. You search his
body and find 2 Gold Pieces, his fare from the last
crossing. You curse him for trying to overcharge
you. Add the 2 Gold Pieces to your Gold and row
yourself across the river. Add 2 LUCK points. As
you moor the boat on the north bank you look back
at the body. It has vanished!
