As you speak the old man rises to his feet. ‘Oh my,
oh my, a stranger!” he starts. “Well, do come in, the
shop is open. What can I get you? What would you
like to buy? What takes your fancy? Which way are
you headed? North? Well?’ You tell the old man
your story. He listens intently and replies, ‘Oh yes,
in that case you will undoubtedly need one of my °
Blue Candles. That will be 20 Gold Pieces please.
Cash if you don’t mind. Yes, I know it’s expensive,
but isn’t everything these days? Not so long ago
these were only 5 Gold Pieces each; but you know
what has happened to the price of candlewax since
the Long Dark Night - oh, but you probably don’t
since you don’t come from these parts. Never mind.
I can guarantee it’s still worth the price. You might
need it sooner than you think ...’
If you decide to buy a candle, pay for it and add it to
your Equipment List. You are getting a little tired of
his constant prattling. Leave the room and go
northwards.
