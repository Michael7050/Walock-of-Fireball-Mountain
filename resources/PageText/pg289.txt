You look frantically round the room but can see
nothing to aid you. Suddenly your eyes stop on the
pack of cards he was fingering as you entered, and
you remember the rumours and stories the villagers
told you: ‘The Warlock’s power comes from his
cards.’ The sorcerer sees your interest in them and
you both rush for the table. You get there first.
‘Leave those alone,’ he screams, ‘or you risk my
fullest wrath!’ But you move backwards and set fire
to one with your lantern. He cries out wildly and
then begins to plead with you to leave them alone.
One by one you burn the cards and, as you do so,
the Warlock diminishes in stature. As the last card
goes up in flames, he stands facing you, a broken
man. ‘My book!’ he croaks, and he tries to unlock
the door on the far side. You race across to him with
your sword drawn and spring at him. Resolve this
battle.
