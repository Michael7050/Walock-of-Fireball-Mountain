The passage ahead ends at a sturdy door. You listen
but hear nothing. You try the handle, it turns, and
you enter the room. As you look around you hear a
loud cry from behind you and swing round to see a
wild man leaping towards you wielding a large
battle-axe. He is a mad BARBARIAN and you
must fight him!
There is a door in the north wall opposite, through
which you may Escape during the battle.
