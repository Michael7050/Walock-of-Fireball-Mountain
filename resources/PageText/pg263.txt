dead in his tracks and sinks to the floor, weeping
loudly. As he gradually composes himself, he
thanks you many times. You talk with him in the
hope of discovering some of the secrets of the
mountain and he begins to tell his story. Many years
ago he was an adventurer like you in search of the
Warlock’s treasure. He was captured by the Orcs

the creatures. You ask whether he would like to
accompany you into the mountain, but he simply
wants to leave and see the world again. You ask him
for advice but he says he knows little. He advises
you to pay your respects to the boatman. He tells
you that you must pull the right-hand lever on the
wall ahead to open the iron gate at the end of the
passage. He has also learned that the keys to the
Boat House are guarded by a man and his dog. You
shake hands, leave the room and go your separate
ways. Add 1 Luck.
