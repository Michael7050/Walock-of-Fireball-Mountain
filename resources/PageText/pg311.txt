The passageway ends in a door at which you listen
but hear nothing. Trying the handle, you find that
the door opens to reveal a large, square room. The
room is completely bare, but the floor is covered in a
mosaic of tiles. Two shapes stand out on the floor;
star-shaped tiles and hand-shaped tiles. A door on
the opposite wall is the only way through. Will you:
