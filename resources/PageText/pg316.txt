The water is icy cold. You start to swim and notice
that your splashings are attracting a moving ‘tur-
bulence’ in the water. Will your strength and
stamina hold out? Roll two dice. If the roll is equal to
or less than your STAMINA Score, you believe you
can make it and swim furiously for the north bank.
If the roll totals more than your
STAMINA score, you decide not to risk it and return
to the south bank.
You may eat Provisions on the south bank.
