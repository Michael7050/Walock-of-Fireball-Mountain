The Wight lies in a heap in the corner of the room.
You approach his desk and open the box. There are
18 Gold Pieces within the box. You take these
with you â€” enter them on your Adventure Sheet. You
add 2 Luck points for defeating the creature
and may rest a while to take some Provisions. When
you are ready, you may leave by the north door.
