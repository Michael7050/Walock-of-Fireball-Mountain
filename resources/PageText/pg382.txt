You hold the Eye up in front of him and the jewel
gives off a dull glow. You point it towards him and
he shrieks! He backs away into a corner and a beam
of light shoots from the jewel. As it falls on him he
sinks to the floor and a remarkable transformation
takes place. He starts to shrivel and grow visibly old
in front of you. His skin wrinkles and cracks and he
slowly becomes an amorphous heap in the corner.
After some moments, the jewel stops glowing and
you approach the lifeless bundle of cloth; his robes
are all that remain.
