You find a secret door which opens into the bend
where two passageways meet. To the north a short
passage runs into a dead end, and to the east, the
passageway reaches a crossroads. If you will step
through this secret door into the passageway, turn
to (1). If you decide against going through the sec-
ret door, close it and return down the passage to the
crossroads (2).
