The sleeping creature awakens startled. He jumps
up and rushes at you, unarmed. With your sword
you should be able to defeat him, but his sharp teeth
look rather vicious. You may Escape through the
door or stand and fight the ORC who is attacking you.
If you defeat the creature, you may take the box.
