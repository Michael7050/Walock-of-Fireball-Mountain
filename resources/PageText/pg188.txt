He now stands just under two metres tall. He
advances towards you. His body is hairy. His teeth
are pointed. His eyes flash. His fingernails are sharp
claws. His nose has become a rat-like snout. He is a
WERERAT!
Resolve your battle with him. If you decide to Escape,
you may run over the rickety bridge.
