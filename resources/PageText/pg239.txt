You think back to the words of the old man. ‘You
might need it sooner than you think ...’ You grope
in your pack and pull out the candle. Immediately it
lights itself of its own accord. The howling stops and
the room appears bathed in a blue light from the
candle. On the walls, the figures in the mural are
moving! They are mouthing silent screams as if trap-
ped in a two-dimensional hell. On the wall opposite
is another door, which you may leave through (1),
or you may stay to investigate (2).
