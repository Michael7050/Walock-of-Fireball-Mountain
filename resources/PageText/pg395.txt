You step over the bones on the floor to take a closer
look at the Boat House. You pick up and study a few
of the tools scattered around: hammers, nails,
chisels and the like, but they appear very ordinary.
You hear a banging sound coming from beyond the
north door and have time for one further search
before you must react. Do you look through the
drawers of the benches around the room (1)
or check the tools more carefully (2)?
