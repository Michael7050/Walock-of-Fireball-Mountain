The creature now standing before you is a semi-
decayed man. His quick eyes dart from side to side
watching you. His long tongue flashes out with a
hissing noise. His teeth and nails are sharp and he
doesnâ€™t seem to be afraid of your weapon. He is a
GHOUL!
He has the ability to paralyse you if he scores four separate wounds on you during this battle, so
beware!
