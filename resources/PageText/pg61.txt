As you investigate the cavern, you suddenly hear a
scurry of steps behind you and swing round to face
the grotesque black shape of a GIANT SPIDER
which has been stalking you. The Spiderâ€™s body is at
least a metre across and you quickly draw your
sword to defend yourself.
You may Escape from the fight down the passageway
after two Attack Rounds and will end up at the junction.
