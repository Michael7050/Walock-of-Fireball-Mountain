The door opens to reveal a small room with a stone
floor and dirty walls. There is a stale smell in the air.
In the centre of the room is a makeshift wooden
table on which is standing a lit candle. Under the
table is a small box. In the far corner of the room is a
straw mattress. You may either open the box (1) or
leave the room (2).
