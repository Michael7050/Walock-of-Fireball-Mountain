The body on the floor turns visibly older in front of
your eyes. The face looks fifty, then ninety, then
well over a hundred years old. The skin rots and the
eyes decompose as you watch. You notice a move-
ment coming from the creatureâ€™s chest. As the
remnants of the Vampire decay, a small black face
breaks through its chest. It resembles a small black
shrew, but as it frees itself and unfurls its wings you
realize it is a bat. You lunge at it, but it flaps away
into the darkness.
You search the whole chamber quickly (remember,
there are several other coffins there!) and find 30
Gold Pieces, and a book, which you take.
You can leave through the west door. If
you are hungry you may take Provisions here, and
you add 3 LUCK points for defeating the Vampire.
