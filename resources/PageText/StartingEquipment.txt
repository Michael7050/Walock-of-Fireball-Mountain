You will start your adventure with a bare minimum
of equipment, but you may find other items during
your travels. You are armed with a sword and are
dressed in leather armour. You have a rucksack
(haversack, backpack) on your back to hold your
Provisions and any treasures you may come across.
You also carry a lantern which lights your way.
In addition, you may take one bottle of a magical
potion which will aid you on your quest. You may
choose to take a bottle of any of the following:
A Potion of Skill — restores sKILL points
A Potion of Strength ~ restores STA MINA points
A Potion of Fortune — restores LUCK points and
adds 1 to Initial LUCK
These potions may be taken at any time during your
adventure. Taking a measure of potion will restore
SKILL, STAMINA Or LUCK scores to their Initial
level (and the Potion of Fortune will add 1 point to
your Initial LUCK score before LUCK is restored).
Each bottle of potion contains enough for two
measures i.e. the characteristic may be restored
twice during an adventure. Each time it is used
make a note on your Adventure Sheet.
Remember also that you may only choose one of the
three potions to take on your trip, so choose wisely!
