The door opens into a short corridor about fifteen
metres long. There are two doors, one at each end.
You now realize what the noise was. More Skele-
tons! Four of them, armed with swords, are running
down the corridor towards you.
They donâ€™t appear to have seen you and you notice a
slight recess in the wall which may be a useful
hiding place. You decide to try it.
