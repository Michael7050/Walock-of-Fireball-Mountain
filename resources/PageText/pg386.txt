You climb on the raft and start to punt your way .
across the river. The going is not easy. In the middle
of the river the raft seems to take on a will of its own
and bobs up and down dangerously. You realize it is
attempting to capsize itself and throw you into the
river! You may either trust your strength and luck to
hold on and keep punting to the north side (1)
or jump into the water and attempt to swim back
to the south bank (2).
