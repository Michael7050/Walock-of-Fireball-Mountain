The box contains a small leather-bound book
entitled The Making and Casting of Dragonfire. You
open the pages and begin to read. Fortunately it is
written in your own language and so was probably
not understood by the Orcs — otherwise this treas-
ure would certainly not be as loosely guarded as it
was.
The book is written in tiny handwriting by Farrigo
Di Maggio. In it he tells the story of his life’s work;
the creation of the Dragonfire spell with which to
fight evil Dragons. You read how, in his last years,
Farrigo finally perfected his spell but by then was
too old to make use of it. So he completed his book,
locked it in a chest and hid it in the depths of Firetop
Mountain, afraid that it might fall into the wrong
hands. The last page reads:

"And So, you who now hold this book,
you have my life's work in your hands.
The power of destruction is yours if you
wish it, but do not waste it. Unless you
use the Spell for the purpose for which it
was intended, you shall be consumed by fire
from your hands. Remember, only when the
Dragon breathes its fire at you should you
raise your arms and say:
                  Ekil Erif
                  Ekam Erif
                  Erif Erif
                  'Di Maggio' "
You say these words slowly and softly. Suddenly
the pages seem to glow and as this glow disappears,
so do the words on the pages of the book. You
repeat the spell to yourself to memorize it and leave
the room.
