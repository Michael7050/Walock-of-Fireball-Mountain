The door opens to reveal a small, smelly room. In
the centre of the room is a rickety wooden table on
which stands a lit candle. Underneath the table is a -
small wooden box. Asleep ona straw mattress in the
far corner of the room is a short, stocky creature
with an ugly, warty face; the same sort of creature
that you found asleep at the sentry post. He must be
the guard for the night watch. You may either
return to the corridor and press on northwards (1)
or creep into the room and try to take the box
without waking the creature. If you want to try to
steal the box, Test your Luck (2). If you are Lucky, he
does not wake up.
