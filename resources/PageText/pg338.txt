You approach the statue cautiously. A scampering
behind you makes you flash round . . . but it is only a
rat. You feel at the jewel, but it is solidly in place.
You try to work your sword in behind it and as
you work, you hear an ominous creaking noise. To
your horror the statue is beginning to move! You
jump down and draw your sword. The IRON
CYCLOPS cranes its head round towards you and
steps down from its pedestal. You must fight!
If you want to Escape during
combat, you can run through the door back to the
junction.
