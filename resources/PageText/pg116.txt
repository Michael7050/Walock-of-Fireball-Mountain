The two drunken ORCS you now face are obvi-
ously startled at your entrance and, as quickly as
they are able, they fumble around for the weapons.
You must attack each one in turn. Their drunken-
ness allows you to add 1 point to your dice roll when
rolling to work out your Attack Strength, during
each Attack Round.If you wish to
Escape during the battle, you may do so.
