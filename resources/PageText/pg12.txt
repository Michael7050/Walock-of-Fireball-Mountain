As you pull the knob, a deafening clanging noise
rings through the passageways. You frantically
push the knob back to stop the alarm, but it has
already had its effect. You can hear footsteps
coming closer down the corridor.
When you have defeated this creature, you may
either return to the junction (1) or you may
push the knob (2).
