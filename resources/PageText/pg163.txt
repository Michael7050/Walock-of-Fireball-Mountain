You draw your sword and enter the cavern. The
Giant stops in the middle of a mouthful, raises his
head and sniffs the air. He swings round and
catches sight of you approaching. Roaring loudly,
he flings the pig's carcass at you. Test your Luck, If
you are Lucky, it misses. If you are Unlucky, it hits
you with quite some force â€”lose 1 STAMINA point.
Then he picks up his hammer and prepares to club
you with it. Resolve this battle.
You may Escape after three Attack Rounds down the
passageway, where he will not be able to follow.
