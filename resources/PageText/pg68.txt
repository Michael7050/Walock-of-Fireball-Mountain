The two GOBLIN torturers look at each other
amazed, then look at you. They chatter to them-
selves and then indicate for you to wait while they
go off and get another Dwarf to give them some
more fun. They disappear out of the room and you
cut down the Dwarf who is, as you guessed, quite
dead. You decide it best to leave and press on
northwards up the corridor.
