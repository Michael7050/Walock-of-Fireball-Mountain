You lunge at the old man as he leaps towards you
with outstretched arms â€” and run him through the
chest with your sword. You curse as you realize that
he was making no attempt to attack you; his wild

having been imprisoned for what had apparently
been a very long time. You will now get no informa-
tion out of him on the perils of the adventure ahead.
