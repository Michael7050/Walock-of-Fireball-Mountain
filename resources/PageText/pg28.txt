The mighty Giant lies dead! You search his cavern
and find little of use, although a purse in his belt
contains 8 Gold Pieces. You are a little concerned
about the second chair; to whom does it belong?
You decide to leave the cavern the way you came.
But add 2 LUCK and 2 SKILL points for
your victory.
