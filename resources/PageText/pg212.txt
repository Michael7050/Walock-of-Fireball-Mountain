The parchment is well worn and almost illegible. It
is a map of some sort, headed ‘The Maze of Zagor’.
You can make little sense of it, although a room to
the north is marked ‘... GER’ and another to the
east is marked ‘SM... P...LE’.
You fold up the map and put itin your pocket. If you
have not yet tested the liquid and wish to do so,(1)
Otherwise, you can make your way north-
wards (2).
