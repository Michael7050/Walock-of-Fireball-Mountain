The battle will call upon all your reserves of strength
and cunning. Your adversary has disappeared, and
now stands at the far end of the room in front of a
door with two locks. How will you approach him:
Grip your sword firmly and
advance towards him? (1)
Look through your pack fora
weapon to use? (2)
Look around the room for another
means of attack or defence? (3)
