The passage widens and you realize you are about
to enter a large cavern. You can hear noises coming
from the cavern ahead and you proceed cautiously.
As you approach, you can make out a large figure in
the distance and you are overawed as you realize
that this oversized human must be at least three
metres tall! Dressed in a leather tunic, the creature is
absorbed in a meal he is eating at a table.
The cavern is at least a hundred metres across and
must be the home of this GIANT. A large table and
two chairs are along one of the walls, and it is here
that the creature sits. Intent on his meal (a large pig),
he is unlikely to notice you. Around the rest of the
cavern you can see his straw mattress, a great furry
pelt which may be his blanket ora shawl, and a huge
stone-headed hammer, which you would have no
hope of budging. A fire burns in one corner of the
cavern, under a hole in the ceiling. There appears to
be no other way through the cavern. Will you take
on this brute (1) or return to the junction
(2)?
