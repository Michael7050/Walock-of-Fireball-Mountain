You follow the passage westwards until it turns
round a corner to the south. Just before the bend is a
signpost which reads ‘Under Construction’. In front
of you is the beginning of a stairway leading downwards.
Only three steps have been built so far. A
number of shovels, picks and other tools were lying
on the ground by the steps but, as you turned the
corner, they suddenly flurried into action and began
working on the steps. You are now watching
various tools digging and hammering as if being
handled by invisible workers. A humming chant
becomes louder and you recognize it as: ‘Heigh-ho,
Heigh-ho, It’s off to work we go ...’ As you stand
watching you start to chuckle — the scene is quite
amusing. You sit and watch and even manage to
chat to some of the magical tools. Gain 2 STAMINA
points and 1 SKILL point whilst you relax. Then
turn back up the passageway to the crossroads
where you may go either northwards (1) or
southwards (2).
