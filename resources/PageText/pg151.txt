You gain ground on the ‘turbulence’ in the water
but a few metres from the north bank you notice two
sinister reptilian eyes on the surface of the water
watching you. You are swimming straight for them.
If you decide you'd rather not face the owner of the
eyes, you may turn round and head straight back to
the south bank at full speed — you arrive exhausted
and lose 1 STAMINA point (1). Alterna-
tively you can risk the eyes ahead — (2). You
may try a detour which will send you nearer the
‘turbulence’ — (3).
