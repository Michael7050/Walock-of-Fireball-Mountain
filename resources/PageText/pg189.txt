The door opens into a short corridor which ends
several metres ahead at another door, similar to the
one you have just come through. You listen and -
hear nothing. You try the handle and it turns, allow-
ing you into another room of a similar size. But this
room is splendidly decorated, with a polished mar-
ble floor and rough walls painted white. On each of
the four walls hangs a painting, and there is another
door in the north wall. You can either go straight
through the room (1) or you may stop to
look at the paintings (2).
