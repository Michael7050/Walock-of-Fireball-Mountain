The bridge is slippery from the splashings of the
water. At one point you slip on a tuft of wet moss
covering the timbers. Roll one die. A roll of 6 means
you slip from the bridge into the water below and
start swimming for the nearest bank.
Any other roll is lucky; you managed to hold on and
vou reach the north bank.
