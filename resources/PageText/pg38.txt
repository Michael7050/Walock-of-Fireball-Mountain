You open the door to find the Werewolfâ€™s larder, a
miscellaneous collection of bones and decaying
meats. The smell is nauseating, although a jar of
pickled eggs seems to offer fairly palatable food. If
you wish to take these, there will be enough for two
meals; add 2 points to your Provisions.
Back in the room you may now go out through the
south door.
