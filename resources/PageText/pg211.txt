Wights are vulnerable only to weapons made of
solid silver, If the weapon you are using is not made
of silver, have one more Attack Round. Remember
that any wounds he inflicts on you will count, but
your wounds will not harm him, and he will still be
at full strength unless you have chosen a silver weapon.
If you have a silver weapon, vou had better use it
now. (1) If vou have not, or if you have
suffered enough damage, you’d better run for the
north door — (2). Remember that you are
Escaping here and he inflicts a final wound as you
flee.
