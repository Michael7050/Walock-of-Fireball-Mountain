Using the wooden stake and mallet (or makeshift
mallet if you aren’t carrying one), you form a cross
and move towards the Vampire, backing it into a
corner. It hisses and snatches at you but cannot
come near you. However, it is going to be tricky
getting the stake through its heart.
As you advance, you stumble and fall forwards. As
luck would have it, the stake flies forward and
plunges into the shrieking creature. Test your Luck. If
you are Lucky, the stake pierces the Vampire’s
heart. If you are Unlucky, the Vampire is merely
grazed by the wound (deduct 3 points from its
STAMINA) and it flings you backwards across the
room towards the west door. You can escape through it,
or keep on fighting. If you were Lucky and killed the Vampire,
you may look for its treasure.
