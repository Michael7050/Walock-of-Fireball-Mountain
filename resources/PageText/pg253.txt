The passageway ends in another wooden door, this
time a small one with a carved bone handle. You
listen but hear nothing coming from inside. You try
the handle and the door opens into a pear-shaped
room with a rough stone floor, making walking
across it somewhat awkward. In one corner of the
room is a pile of rubble, mainly stones and dust, but
there are also two odd-shaped pieces of wood and a
length of rope. A door in the north wall leads on.
Will you:
Examine the bits of wood? (1)
Study the length of rope? (2)
Leave through the north door? (3)
