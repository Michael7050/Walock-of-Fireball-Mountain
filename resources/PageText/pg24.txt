After you have suffered your third wound, you
notice that your strength is ebbing. Lose 1 SKILL
point. You deduce that this is yet another magical
power of this foul creature and you feel a shiver of
panic. Will you continue or run? If you want to
Escape, pay the penalty and flee
through the north door. Otherwise the fight goes
on, but from now on every third wound that the beast
inflicts takes 1 point from your SKILL.
