The door opens into a small room, comfortably fur-
nished with a table, several chairs and a large book-
case which covers one wall. Seated at the table is an
old man with a long grey beard, and squatting on
the old manâ€™s shoulder is a small winged beast. This
creature is no more than six centimetres tall. It has
two arms and legs; its skin is a dusty grey colour. It
has tiny sharp white teeth and its wings are folded
behind its back. The old man says nothing as you
walk in through the door, but he beckons you over
to sit down at the table. He is tossing in his hand two
small white objects. Will you:
Sit down as he tells you? (1).
Leave the room and return to the
junction? (2).
Draw your sword and rush
forward? (3).
