Two of the keys fit the locks perfectly. The other
doesnâ€™t. You leap to one side as a jet of clear liquid
spurts from the chest. It just misses, but you lose
2 STAMINA points as the liquid emits an acidic
vapour which makes you cough and choke.
You return to the chest and try another combination
of three keys. Add the key totals and turn to that
section.
If you have no more keys to try, you sit down
exhausted and in despair after having got so near to
your goal. Remember to look for keys next time you
enter the dungeon!
