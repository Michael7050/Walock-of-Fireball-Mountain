The Ghoul twitches and dies at your feet. You
search its body and find little of interest. A couple of
earrings, worth 1 Gold Piece - between them, are in
one of its pockets. You take these. If you
haven't already searched the first body, you do so
and find 5 Gold Pieces, which you also take.
You may also stop here, rest and eat Provisions. You
add 2 Luck points for killing the Ghoul. Now
you may either press on northwards (1) or
search the second body (2).
