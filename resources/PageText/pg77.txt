Several metres up the passageway you arrive at a
junction where you may turn either west or east. Set
in the rock on the north wall is a small recess where
you may rest and eat Provisions without being seen.
If you wish to take Provisions here, do so. After-
wards you may set off either eastwards (1)
or westwards (2).
