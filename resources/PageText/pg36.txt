The locked door bursts open and a nauseating
stench hits your nostrils. Inside the room the floor is
covered with bones, rotting vegetation and slime. A
wild-haired old man, clothed in rags, rushes at you
screaming. His beard is long and grey, and he is
waving an old wooden chair-leg. Is he simply
insane as he appears, or has this been some kind of
trap? You may either shout at him to try to calm him
down (1) or draw your sword and attack
him (2).
