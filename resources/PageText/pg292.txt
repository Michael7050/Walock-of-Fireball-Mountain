Northwards the passageway ends ata solid wooden
door. You listen at the door but can hear nothing.
There appears to be no choice but to open the door
and enter the room, which you do. It’s a large,
square room. You flash your lantern around the
room and catch a quick glimpse of its emptiness —
although there are murals on the wall - before your
lantern suddenly goes out. You try to re-light it, but
it will not catch. In the blackness you hear a succes-
sion of frightful noises. Howls, screams, cries and
wails are getting louder and louder until they reach
the pitch where you must cover your ears. Do you
have a Blue Candle? If so, (1). If not, (2).
