Silver weapons only will be effective here. When
the creature inflicts its third wound on you, change pages.
If you defeat it before this happens, head to the next page,
or you may Escape through the north door.
If you can use ‘The Giver of Sleep’, Test your
Luck. If you are Lucky, you hit and the creature dies
instantly. If you are Unlucky, you miss.
