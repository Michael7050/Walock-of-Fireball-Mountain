You walk westwards along the passageway. After
fifty metres or so, the way turns northwards. Two or
three paces up the passage, you hear a crumbling
beneath your feet and you try to leap back as the
ground gives way. Test your Luck. If you are Lucky,
you manage to leap quickly backwards before a pit
opens. If you are Unlucky, you are too slow and you
fall over two metres down into a pit â€” lose 1
STAMINA point. If you were Lucky, you had better
return to the junction.
