The lock was obviously inadequate; it flies off and
lands on the floor several metres away. You lift up
the heavy lid and your eyes widen as you see the
gold sheen coming from within. A fair number of
Gold Pieces are inside. In one corner lies a small
black bottle with a tight glass stopper, containing a
liquid of some kind. Also in the chest is a silky black
glove. But as you are admiring this treasure you
hear a soft click and wince in pain as a small dart
shoots forward into your stomach. Roll one die and
subtract this number of points from your STAMINA
to determine the effect of the poison on the dart tip.
