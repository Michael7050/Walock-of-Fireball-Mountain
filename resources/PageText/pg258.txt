You sort through the broken pots and find little of
interest. The liquid looks, smells and tastes like
water. The coins in the pot are a fraud. Eight
genuine Gold Pieces lie on the surface of the pile
(and you take these) but underneath are merely
painted pieces of pot.
As you tip the vase out it slips and breaks. A red-
coloured key appears, hidden inside a false bottom
in the bowl. You take this key. It is inscribed
with the number 111.
You may rest here and eat some Provisions. You
add 2 Luck points for defeating the Minotaur.
Finally you leave the room.
