You leave the cavern along a long, narrow corridor.
After several hundred metres, it ends at a large
wooden door which is slightly ajar. Carefully you
ease it open a little further and poke your head
around the side to see what is in the room. You see a
small old man sitting at a table on his own, playing
with a pack of cards. He looks quite a harmless old
soul, grey-haired and bearded. He is seated, What
will you do:
Burst through the door, sword
drawn, to surprise the old man? (1)
Knock on the door and enter,
greeting the old man
courteously? (2)
Get down on all fours and try to
creep into the room unnoticed? (3)
