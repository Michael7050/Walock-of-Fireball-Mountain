The passageway ahead runs northwards for some
time. You may rest along the passage to eat Pro-
visions. It then bends to the west and begins to get
quite narrow. You reach a small rocky arch which
you will have to stoop to get through. On the other
side of the arch you pause and look around. You are
in a large cavern which disappears into distant
blackness. The cavern is partially lit by natural light
which streams in through a hole in the roof. You
cannot see a way through.
As you shine your lantern around the cavern, you
hear a rumble. A dull glow flickers in the blackness.
Suddenly, a jet of fire shoots from the depths of the
cavern, narrowly missing you and singeing the
mossy growths on the wall! You throw yourself on
to the ground and look up to see a large DRAGON
stalking out of the darkness towards you. Smoke
curls from its nostrils. Its scaly red skin glistens with
an oily covering. The beast is some fifteen metres
long! How will you attack the creature?
