The creature catches your eye with its own gaze and
you -find yourself unable to control your own
actions. It beckons you forward. You move slowly
towards it with your mouth gaping open. It tells you
to throw down the stake. As you look down at the
stake, you suddenly feel a surge of power return to
your own will, and you fling the stake at him from
close range.
Test your Luck.
